I don't like repetitive tasks so my software designs normally come with the idea of minimizing the number of tasks needed\n          to maintain or add new functionalities. For me is important to invest time to improve the quality of your future work and optimize to the maximum resources.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Aware of technological news</h4>\n        <p>\n          Up to date in last technologies, and always seeking to learn and use them in a real-world scenario.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Finding a way to do it better</h4>\n        <p>\n          I won't settle just by solving the problem and I am always struggling to find\n          a better way to do it.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Motivations</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            A challenge.\n          </li>\n          <li>A variable environment where I can learn and switch between technologies.</li>\n          <li>\n            Freedom. I actively do research to have my work environment as optimized\n            as possible so having the freedom to configure it and not\n            having restrictions when I solve a problem helps me maximize\n            productivity. \n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>Hobbies</h3>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Thinking</li>\n          <li>Software</li>\n          <li>Music</li>\n          <li>Fixing devices</li>\n          <li>Getting away from the routine</li>\n        </ul>",
